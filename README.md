Onboarding QA Tool

This is a simple Google Chrome extension I created for use at work in checking real estate property links.

The following functions are available for use:
1. Open Links at Once - Fetches all links in a page and opens and loads a new tab for each;
2. Lazy Load Links - Fetches all link links in a page and opens a new tab for each but waits for the tab to be focused before loading it;
3. Get All Links (CSV) - Fetches all links with the associated anchor text and exports it to CSV; and
4. Check Links in Background - Fetches all links and checks for each link's validity using Fetch API.
